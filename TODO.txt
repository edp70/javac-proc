== github ==

turn these TODO items into github issues?

bugs have been moved to github issue tracker.

== testing ==

 * would be nice if Tree{Printer,Dumper}{1,2} output could be printed
   for failing tests only. would be nice if it could be dumped to
   files instead of stdout too.

 * more tests always good...
 * code coverage!
 * better "xfail" support would be nice.
 * would be nice if AbstractTryTests (eg) could read code fragments
   from files as well as literal strings.

== refactoring: separation of detection vs mutation ==

 * It might be better if FR/JT were rewritten so that there were
   something like JT but which just *finds* "escaping" jumps, without
   mutating anything, first. Then we can rewrite those jumps as
   appropriate depending on whether finallyCanCompleteNormally, ie
   as "break #Try" or "break #J1/#J2/etc".

   Similarly, for ReturnViaBreak, could consider something which finds
   "escaping returns". Specifically, we're interested in return from
   try/catch which has a finally block. Those are the ones which need
   to be routed through a copy of the finally block (in order to
   rewrite without "finally") and therefore need to be translated to a
   "break". Rewriting just those returns would eliminate unnecessary
   changes and have the nice side effect of making RVB idempotent (as
   noted below).

   (Took a shot at implementing the detection part of that last idea
   in ReturnScanner. In theory, just rewrite RVB to use it. But
   actually, probably want to keep the current RVB translator for
   testing purposes. So will need a separate translator/processor,
   different names, etc.)

== other processor ideas ==

 * check the impact of JCTree "pos" field by mutating it. set it to
   zero everywhere. make it go backwards (start at MAXINT and
   decrement).

 * StringifyBareAssertions: assert EXPR; => assert EXPR : "EXPR";

== idempotence ==

It would be nice if processors were idempotent. ReturnViaBreak is not,
I'm pretty sure. Maybe the others are.

== Checker ==

Why does Checker allow "m.sym" (where m is javac JCMethodDecl) to be
dereferenced, when it can be null? Is that a bug in a stub file or
annotated JDK or something? Is it running with unsafe settings?

Same thing applies to JCBreak.{label,target} and presumably tons of
other stuff.

== modules / dependencies ==

Would like to split up various modules and manage them independently,
but for now it's convenient to have everything in one tree, with
minimal dependencies.

Current dependencies:

 * JDK 8             (tested with 1.8.0_66)
 * Checker Framework (tested with 1.9.10)
 * JUnit             (tested with 4.10)

== other ==

 * grep for TODO and XXX...

== code style / hygiene ==

Checkstyle can probably check the following:

 * no unused imports
 * properly sorted imports
 * no tabs, no trailing whitespace

== "control" module ==

maybe copy 'control' subpkg from java-misc/jtree as well, even though
it's pretty much just a sketch, and not sure what it's really good
for.
