  <!-- Same as regular build but compiles src/main with
       ReturnViaBreak1 and *without* NullnessChecker.

       Does not run NullnessChecker because there are some
       transformations done by RVB1 which produce code for which
       Checker produces false positive errors, eg having to do with
       control flow and finally blocks - ie exactly the problem all
       this code was written to solve in the first place.

       Requires regular build to be run first (so that RVB1 is defined
       in dist/whatever.jar). -->
